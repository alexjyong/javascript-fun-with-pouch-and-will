require ('./photos.js')
// console.log(PHOTOS)

// Filter out just png files
console.log(PHOTOS.filter(photo => photo.format == 'png'))
// Now just print their names
console.log(PHOTOS.filter(photo => photo.format == 'jpg').map(entry => entry.filename))

// Ok here's some things for us to work on together
// Find any entries with the keyword 'Sunny Crest', print name & filepath
// How many of the photos are in the jpg format?
// Replace source names of 'Brian Capouch' with 'Brian L. Capouch'

// And then some things for you to work on as homework
// 1. Add some entries with different keywords (some same) and filetypes (Shoot for 8)
// 2. Run our "in-class" examples; make sure they work
// 3. Print the names of all the different unique sources
// 4. Count how many images contain a given keyword
